        <h1>Absurd Trolley Problems 2 BETA</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">
            This game is meant to be an extension of the ABSURD TROLLEY PROBLEMS game made on neal.fun's site. I had a lot of fun playing his game and wanted to create some of my own creative trolley problems. All credit to him for coming up with this idea. My version is not nearly as polished as his so I would highly encourage you to play his <a href="https://neal.fun/absurd-trolley-problems/" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>
        <!-- <p class="intro-text">
            Also a huge thank you to Gabe Albertini for helping me come up with and edit these scenarios. Gabe has an amazing mind for these kinds of things and I would not have been able to make the game this creative without his help. You can check out his website <a href="https://gabrielalbertini.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p> -->
        <p class="intro-text">
            Assume that you have the ultimate knowledge in each situation and whatever the scenario says will 100% become true exactly the way it is stated. All drawings were done by me on an iPad using only my finger so get ready for some terrible art.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text warning">
            Warning: This game contains graphic and potentially offensive scenarios that may not be suitable for everyone. These situations are not aimed to attack any belief system, they are simply to question the underlying logic and make the player think. This game was made to be fun and thought-provoking. Please do not take it too seriously. HAVE FUN!

            Consider adding these changes:</p>
        <p class="changes">
                Some kind of system that scores your answers or basically decides what kind of person you are. Could be as simple as like sadist or saint or could make more complicated into like utilitarian, or etc. Also kill counter which shouln't be hard</p>

        <p class="changes">Some kind of dialogue that pops up based on what you answered. This could be some kind of clever retort to your answer.</p>
        <p class="changes">(CONSIDER ADDING FUNCTIONALITY SO THAT IS SCROLLS TO TOP OF PAGE UPON CLICKING NEXT PROBLEM) 
            <p class="changes">Voting still not working properly
